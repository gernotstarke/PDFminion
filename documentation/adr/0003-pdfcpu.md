## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a library/framework for processing PDF files, satisfying the following requirements:

1. Written in Go, so our app remains cross-platform
2. Available under an (non-GNU) Open-Source license
3. Can add pages to existing PDF files

We use [pdfcpu.io](https://pdfcpu.io).

## Consequences

None we're currently aware of.
