I'm currently experimenting with an MVP version of PDFminion, therefore most of the information given here is **NOT** valid any longer.

## Why PDFminion?

When creating PDF documents, you often need to add page numbers, headers, footers, or combine multiple PDF files into a single file.
PDFminion can do that for you - from a terminal and the command line, on MacOS, Linux and Windows platforms.
